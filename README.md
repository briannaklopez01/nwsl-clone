# Welcome to My Mini NWSL Clone ðŸ‘‹

I created this project using **Expo** with a **React Native** and **TypeScript** tech stack. This mini application pulls data from a public API to display information about the **National Womenâ€™s Soccer League (NWSL)**.

Iâ€™m an avid supporter of womenâ€™s sports, especially soccer. I'm passionate about improving the fan experience, whether by attending live games or enhancing applications that support fans. While this mini clone is still a work in progress, I plan to add features from the official NWSL app, including:

- **UI Enhancements** â€“ Improving the overall look and feel of the app.  
- **Favorite Teams and Players** â€“ Users will be able to star their favorite teams and players to stay updated with standings and statistics. Starred teams and players will be accessible in a dedicated tab for easy access.  

## Code Highlights
All work contributed is my own. For a key part of the code sample, check out `/components/NwslSchedule.tsx`, where I:  
- Fetched data from the API.  
- Designed the UI to summarize past games from the 2025 season (Note: The API currently only provides data for past games, not future matches).
